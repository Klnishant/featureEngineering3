    "Ans: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space. It identifies the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the maximum variance in the data. PCA helps to simplify complex datasets while preserving as much information as possible.\n",
